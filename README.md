# ðŸ“Š Retail Sales Forecasting

This project demonstrates a time-series sales forecasting model built using Python, LightGBM, and advanced feature engineering techniques. The goal is to predict monthly sales for various shop-item combinations using historical data.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing for millions of records
- Handling missing data and sparse entries
- Lag and rolling window features for seasonality and trend detection
- Model training using LightGBM with early stopping and validation splits
- Model evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualizations for sales trends, feature importance, and error analysis

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains dataset files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with full implementation
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Learnings
- Feature engineering is crucial for time-series accuracy
- Proper validation splits prevent overfitting
- Visualization helps in diagnosing and improving models

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook to train the model and evaluate results
